VRZOME Development Kit
================

The VRZOME lets you watch 180/360 flat and stereo video on its own development kit. It contains 4K LCD and oculus IMU sensor, and use Chrome web broser.

Videos shown in the player can be rotated using keyboard controls  (a/d, w/s, and q/e), as well as by the Oculus Rift if you are running an experimental webVR browser. You may be able to decrease video judder by setting your Oculus Display refresh rate to 60 Hz (the browser refreshes at 60 Hz and the slower mismatch can cause judder).
